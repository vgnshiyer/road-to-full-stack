# Jeopardy

#### Message for grader:

- I have implemented fetch calls at the beginning of the application.
- So the api is only called once throughout the application runtime.
- The questions and the True/False buttons are displayed separately at the center of the screen instead of below the table. It is purely a design decision as displaying too many things on a single page was making it look cluttered.
